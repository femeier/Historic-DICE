The mathematica notebook evaluates the carbon cycle for given historical CO2 emissions. Two output files are generated in the notebook, the output of FaIR to be used then in the optimization and the dalpha file which provides the initial value for the discretization. Note that given the initial values the development of FaIR Carbon cycle and Geoffroy temperature dynamics are evaluated in the ampl code.
